# QuoteOfTheDay
A simple website that shows random inspirational quotes to visitors

This website runs on Apache Web Server. To run it properly install XAMPP if you don't have it. Then create a sub-directory called QuoteOfTheDay in XAMPP/htdocs directory and put all the files in this repository there. Then open phpMyAdmin and export the database quote_of_the_day.sql. After that open your browser and go to localhost/QuoteOfTheDay and you should see the homepage with a random quote.

If it doesn't work, please let me know.
